## Installation
To install and run the Cancer Detector with AI, follow these steps:

### Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
### Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the application:
```sh
python app.py
```
## Usage
Once the application is running, access the user interface through your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Upload the medical images or patient data, and the system will analyze and provide a cancer detection report.

## Model Training
To train the cancer detection model on your own dataset:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure it is in the appropriate format (e.g., images in specified folders, CSV files for tabular data).
Configure the training script: Modify the config.yaml file to set the parameters for your training.
Run the training script:
```sh
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
The trained model will be saved in the models directory.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the provided test dataset:

Run the evaluation script:

```sh
python evaluate.py --model models/your_model.pth --data data/test
```
View the results: The evaluation metrics will be displayed, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
